# Monaco Nerd Font

Terminal-friendly monaco font, with extra nerd glyphs, patched with [ryanoasis's nerd patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
This version is updated and is more compatible with tools such as [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

The nerd font file name is called Monaco Nerd Font Complete.ttf
I've also added a ligaturized version on Monaco with the name of Liga Monaco.ttf
Note: The ligaturized version does not include the Nerd Font, it is just a ligaturized version for IDEAs and such
